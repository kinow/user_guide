# Quick start

TODO:

- An under 10 minutes intro to CWL, for users who may have no idea what are CWL, cwltool, workflows, etc.
- We can use text from the **episodes 1 and 2** from the current User Guide - https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/01-introduction/index.html & https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/02-1st-example/index.html
- Mention that we can write `CommandLineTool` or `Workflow` as entry point (not sure if other Processes are allowed too? But I think we should focus on cwltool in this user guide). I remember this was confusing for me at first.
- Explain what is a Job Order file. I remember not having a clue when I saw that text the first time.
- Shorter version of https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2813589/wiki/401467 ?
- Point out that we use JSON and YAML, maybe add a link to docs to clarify some of the syntax gotchas, like `-` in YAML - https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language/issues/318
- Maybe add the existing **episode YAML** from the current User Guide - https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/yaml/index.html
